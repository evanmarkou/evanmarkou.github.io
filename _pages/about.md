> I am a third-year PhD student at the Australian National University, focusing on theoretical machine learning and deep learning theory. I'm very grateful to be supervised by [Stephen Gould](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~sgould/), [Thalaiyasingam Ajanthan](https://tajanthan.github.io/), and [Marcus Hutter](https://www.hutter1.net/index.htm).
>
> My research lies at the intersection of deep learning, optimisation, and geometry, with an emphasis on building a more rigorous theoretical understanding of neural networks.
>
> ### Core Research Interests
>
> * The Geometry of Deep Learning: I analyse the geometric structure of the loss landscape and solution space in deep neural networks. My goal is to characterise the properties of optimal solutions in over-parameterised models using tools from differential geometry and frame theory.
>
> * Optimisation and Convergence: I study convergence guarantees in non-convex optimisation. This involves exploring how geometric conditions such as reduction mappings, can be used to design more efficient and reliable training algorithms.
>
> * Generalisation and Occam's Razor: I work on developing novel generalisation bounds for neural networks by applying concepts from algorithmic information theory and topology. This aims to better quantify the true capacity and regularity of learned models.

I am always open to new collaborations. If you are interested in working together, please feel free to get in touch.
